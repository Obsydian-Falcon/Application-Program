# Pre-work - _Memory Game_

**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program.

Submitted by: **Walker Dauphin II**

Time spent: **3.33 + 45 mins of writeup** hours spent in total

Link to project: (insert your link here, should start with [https, this here be my link](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/copper-sturdy-eel?path=README.md%3A7%3A17))

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

- [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
- [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked.
- [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked.
- [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
- [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess.
- [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
- [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
- [x] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
- [x] More than 4 functional game buttons
- [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
- [x] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
- [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
- [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
- [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
- [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions

1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here:<br>
  <p>
    I wasn't too sure on how to generate random numbers in Javascrips, so I googled the issue and came across this line of code:<br>
    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4959975/generate-random-number-between-two-numbers-in-javascript
  </p>


2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words
   [Using javascript for the first time was a little jarring. Though I have experience in Java, it's clear that javascript shares some similarities but is overall a different language.
   For one, dynamic typing just made declaring and instantiating variables much easier than in Java. However, as the project went further and further on, It became a bit more difficult to try and remember
   the function and context of each piece of code being implemented. The CSS and HTML parts were so straightforward that I did not need to commit much time in order to understand
   their syntax; however, I did spend more time reading up information on javascript and playing with the provided code to try and understand what was being done on a level deeper than the surface.
   Another challenge I had with the program was that of reapplying logic. During the last part of the project, when different "if" statements were being used to determine a win, I took a moment to
   go over the possibilities. In practicing my "native" language of Java, I would have been able to apply the needed logic in a second, yet in this instance, I needed to take a moment and write it out on
   paper in JS syntax. Overall, I still messed up some lines and had to go over it again, but it was definitely frustrating to so clearly see the solution, but be unable to implement it due to unfamiliarity.
   I did conquer the issue after referring to the reference code provided, but for a minute there, I was just pondering all the ways to do a simple comparison.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   [Since this is my very first time doing anything on the web development side, I would like to know if web development is often like this. In that one might use CSS, HTML, and Javascript to build
   a site or app and have it function properly. Is it best practice to use a combination of the three or are there applications in which only one or two of the languages might be used? After completing
   my submission, I noticed that the time it took to do this was not insiginificant. I mean, sure, I didn't know some of the languages used beforehand but I was still given a tutorial. So the qustion follows
   as such: If a programmer is experienced enough in a languaage as to be considered a professional, how long would it take them to build an application such as the one built here. I could ask 
   how long do bigger projects take in general, but asking about this one gives me a baseline relative to my experience. Thus, making it eeasier to grasp the size of larger projects for more experienced
   individuals.]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   [If I had those hourse I would spend them adding additional features and tweeking the look until it looked just right to me. In terms of features, I think it would be fun to have a musical simon-says memeory game. 
   Where, instead of simply memorizing, you'd also be composing a known song at the same time. This feature would also implement different timings for each button press, to that the song wou;d feel similar in 
   timing to its real counterpart. Another feature that I think would be fun to have would be that of vs mode. A mode in which two sets of buttons were brought up, and you'd try to beat the game faster than the computerg. 
   Finally, another addition to the program could be the customization of difficulty. Having a timed mode that could run quicker and quicker, or simply switching up which squares lit up during which sounds inbetween turns.
